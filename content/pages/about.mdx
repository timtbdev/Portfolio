# Experience

I started learning Android and Frontend development in 2017. I have been launched 2 mobile and 2 web apps, open-sourced them on GitHub. I enjoy making fun and smooth UI's with modern tools like Jetpack Compose, Next.js and Tailwind Css.

Currently, I've been working on personal projects to improve my skills. Outside of Android and Frontend, I'm a passionate runner, husband, and dad.

# Connect

Anyway, that's enough about me.

I'm looking for an entry-level Android or Frontend engineering role. If you think I might be a good fit for your organization, shoot me an email at timtb.dev@gmail.com and let's chat.
